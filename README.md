Smorgs are seven-pointed star-like animals. Each star point has an internal spoke, which runs from the Smorg's hub to the end of the point. Each spoke is divided into an inner spoke and an outer spoke. The inner spoke and outer spoke are always colinear, but each of them is an independent damped spring/muscle. The connection between a point's inner spoke and outer spoke is called a knee. Another damped spring/muscle, called a shin, runs straight from each knee to each adjacent knee. The shin's connection point to the knee is hinged so the shin's angle with the spoke changes freely.
